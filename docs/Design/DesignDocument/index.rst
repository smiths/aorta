Welcome to AortaGeomRecon's documentation!
==========================================

This is the design document for the AortaGeomRecon module, a :term:`3D Slicer` extension to perform :term:`Aorta` segmentation and Aorta geometry reconstruction. 

You can find the source code, the installation guide, and the user manual in the project's `repository <https://github.com/smiths/aorta>`_.

------------

The steps before applying the main algorithm
********************************************

The algorithm works best with the chest volume cropped to a rectangular prism that contains the aorta and parts of the other organs such as the backbone, blood vessels, and the heart. This can be done with :term:`3D Slicer` and its submodule `Volume rendering <https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/volumerendering.html>`_. A detailed guide can be found on the `volume rendering and cropping section <https://github.com/smiths/aorta#to-use-volume-rendering-to-crop-a-voi>`_ of the user instructions. 

After cropping the volume, which only contains the region of interest, the algorithm needs a set of variables inputs from the user. These variables are:

1. :term:`Descending Aorta` and :term:`Ascending Aorta` centre coordinate.
2. :term:`Qualified coefficient`
3. An integer to indicate the number of slices that the algorithm is allowed to skip.


The main ideas of the algorithm
*******************************

At the beginning of the algorithm, the user's input on the aorta centre is used to generate the seed slice, 2-dimensional circle image. This seed slice will be used as a reference throughout the workflow of the algorithm. Therefore, changing the input of the centre coordinate could generate a slightly different segmentation result.

For each slice starting from the user's selected slice going in the inferior or superior direction

1. The algorithm generates a label image by making a grid spacing 3 pixels aparts, overwrites the values of these pixels to white pixel (value of 1).

2. By using `SITK\:\:LabelStatisticsImageFilter <https://simpleitk.org/doxygen/latest/html/classitk_1_1simple_1_1LabelStatisticsImageFilter.html>`_, we get the mean and the sigma of the intensity image with the white pixel.  

    .. note::

       A :term:`Label Statistic coefficient` is used to control the threshold range. With a Larger label statistic coefficient, the algorithm will use a larger range of threshold to perform segmentation.


3. The algorithm then creates another image, the Euclidean distance transform of a binary image as the image intensity map, and uses it with `SITK\:\:ThresholdSegmentationLevelSetImageFilter <https://simpleitk.org/doxygen/latest/html/classitk_1_1simple_1_1ThresholdSegmentationLevelSetImageFilter.html>`_ to create a segmented slice.


4. The algorithm determines whether to accept the segmented slice or not, based on the number of white pixels on the segmented slice, and the qualified coefficient to control the limit.

    .. note::

       To determine whether a segmented slice is acceptable, different conditions are verified for :term:`Descending Aorta` and :term:`Ascending Aorta`. These conditions check are all involved with the :term:`Qualified coefficient`, which is decided by the user. In simple terms, the larger the :term:`Qualified coefficient`, the looser the condition on accepting a segmented slice.

5. If the algorithm accepted this segmented slice, a new centre coordinate is calculated and used as the seed coordinate for segmenting the next slice.

6. When a segmented slice is not acceptable, the algorithm will skip this slice if the number of the skipped slice is less than the integer given by the user. The algorithm will try to replace these skipped slices by reading the overlapped area of the previous and the next slice.
