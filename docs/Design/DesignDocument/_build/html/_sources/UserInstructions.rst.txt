Date of project update: 2023/05/15

The AortaGeomRecon `design
document <https://joviel25.github.io/AortaGR-design-document/index.html>`__
explains in detail of the algorithm workflow; It includes a detailed
glossary of the terms used throughout the other documentation.

This project provides a software tool to semi-automatically segment a 3D
aorta geometry from a chest CT scan. It uses a `3D
Slicer <https://www.slicer.org/>`__ extension in the source folder
(`SlicerExtension/AortaGeometryReconstructor <https://github.com/smiths/aorta/tree/main/src/SlicerExtension/AortaGeometryReconstructor>`__)
to accomplish the goal.

Users must first install the 3D Slicer software, import the extension in
the source folder, and load the CT scans in DICOM file format to 3D
Slicer. Valuable resources for using 3D Slicer includes a `Welcome
tutorial <https://www.dropbox.com/s/vn8sqlof2kag2kk/SlicerWelcome-tutorial_Slicer4.8_SoniaPujol.pdf>`__,
a description of `3D Slicer
user-interface <https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/user_interface.html#application-overview>`__,
information on the `Volume rendering
module <https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/volumerendering.html>`__,

Overview
--------

Automatic aorta segmentation in thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans
is important for aortic calcification quantification and to guide the
segmentation of other central vessels. The work to manually segment
regions of interest can be time-consuming and repetitive, and there are
some automatic aorta segmentation algorithms posted.

This project implemented one of the aorta segmentation algorithms as 3D
Slicer extension module. The algorithm first needs the user to crop the
volume of interest (VOI) by using the 3D Slicer’s volume rendering
module. Next, the user needs to provide two important seeds, the center
point of the descending Aorta and the center point of the ascending
Aorta, as shown by the yellow dots in the image below.

  folder to be loaded to 3D Slicer

To install 3D Slicer and import an extension:
---------------------------------------------

1. Download 3D Slicer from `here <https://download.slicer.org/>`__. This
   project has been tested with the stable release, version 5.0.3.

2. Click on the image below for a video demonstrating the import of
   AortaGeomRecon module, and the complete workflow to perform aorta
   segmentation. |AortaGeomRecon Video instruction|

To apply the segmentation algorithm
-----------------------------------

1. Make sure that you have done the cropping and have a cropped volume
   in phase 1 Crop Aorta, then click on Apply to move to next phase.
2. Once you are in phase 2 Aorta Segmentation, right click on one of the
   red, green or yellow window image area, you should see a list of
   options as shown below.
3. Select the “Slice intersection” option once you have loaded AGR
   module. Right click and check “Interaction” option. Alternatively,
   you can hold “shift” and move around mouse cursor to move around the
   intersection point.

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align:center;line-height:0px;"><img src="_images/Interaction.png" alt="3D Slicer User Interface on Interaction"></p>

4. Hold on Mouse left button to drag and place the intersection point on
   the point of interest, as described in the image from Overview
   section.
5. In phase 2 Aorta Segmentation, you should see that the values of
   DesAortaSeeds and AscAortaSeeds coordinate are changing when moving
   the intersection point. Simply lock one of the two seeds with the
   corresponding checkbox and use intersection to input the other one.
   Make sure you select the two seeds from the same slice. Once you have
   entered all hyperparameters, click on Apply. After a few minutes, you
   should see a new volume named “Seg_th{a number}_k{a number}_c{a
   number}_p{a number}”, the name simply takes some of the important
   hyperparameters as the name, where “th” stands for threshold
   coefficient, k stands for kernel size, c for curvature scaling, and p
   for propagation scaling.

Additional tips for hyperparmeters optimization (based on the 6 samples).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. As tested with the current 6 samples, I would always start with a
   threshold coefficient range of 2-3, a stop limit of 5-6, and kernel
   size of 7-10. This would ensure that the noises (blood vessels,
   backbones) are excluded as much as possible. Then start increasing
   the stop limit, threshold coefficient.
2. Curvature scaling adds weight to the segmentation speed term at the
   curvature. This implies the segmentation result would have high
   probability to include the curvature. However, this might not be the
   best hyperparameter to tune up, because usually the aorta is not an
   isolated island, and it connects to the backbone or other noises.
   Tune this hyperparameter up will segment out any connected island
   (noises).
3. Propagation scaling adds weight to the segmentation speed term in
   general, this means that if not reaching the boarder, the
   segmentation filter will include the next layer of pixels.

To display the segmentation label image
---------------------------------------

1. Use Volume Rendering Module and follow the `step
   2 <https://github.com/smiths/aorta/tree/main#to-use-volume-rendering-to-crop-a-voi>`__
   to display the segmented volume. For example, to show the segmented
   result from phase 2 Descending Aorta Segmentation, you should select
   the volume with the name “Segmented Descending Aorta Volume” by
   default.
2. You can see both the original volume and the segmented volume to see
   the overlaps between the two volumes. Make sure you select the eye
   icon for both volumes, and make sure that the original volume use
   preset of CT-Bones to have the different coloring.

Get the vtk output of the cropped volume or segmentation label image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Use file dialog to select a path.
2. If on phase 1, the program outputs the cropped volume. Otherwise, the
   program outputs the segmentation label image.

Additional tips to use this application:
----------------------------------------

1. The user can save and load an MRML scene object, which is used to
   store all types of data, including the loaded Dicom data, any inputs
   by the user on the UI, markups, etc.
2. In “Application Settings”, and “Modules”, drag
   “AortaGeomReconDisplayModule”, “Volume Rendering”, and “Crop Volume”
   modules to your favorite modules to access these modules quickly from
   UI. Restart the application for the changes to the UI to appear.

The text description version of how to import an extension, load DICOM data, use volume rendering and crop volume:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To import AortaGeomReconDisplay module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Open Slicer application, select “Edit” from the bar menu, then
   “Application Settings” from the drop-down menu.

   -  Select “Modules”, and add the “AortaGeomReconDisplayModule” folder
      in the additional module paths. This folder is located in
      src:raw-latex:`\SlicerExtension`:raw-latex:`\AortaGeometryReconstructor`\\\ `AortaGeomReconDisplayModule <https://github.com/smiths/aorta/tree/main/src/SlicerExtension/AortaGeometryReconstructor>`__.
   -  Restart the application to take into account the new module paths.
   -  Find the “AortaGeomReconDisplayModule” module as shown below:

   .. raw:: html

      <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="_images/ARG_module.png" alt="import AortaGeomRecon module"></p>

To load DICOM data:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Select “File” from the bar menu, then “Add DICOM Data”.
2. The uploaded volume must be a scalar volume object to be viewed in
   the Volume Rendering module. Therefore, to make sure that we are
   uploading volume as a scalar volume, in “Add DICOM data” module,
   unselect the plugin MultiVolumeImporterPlugin as shown below,

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align:center;line-height:0px;"><img src="_images/MultiVolumePlugin.png" alt="DICOM database to disable MultiVolumePlugin"></p>

3. Select “Import DICOM files”, and select one of the patient’s folders.

   -  Once loaded, 3D Slicer will keep the patient record in the DICOM
      database, and the user can easily reload DICOM data from the DICOM
      database.

4. Select the patient file, click “load” button or double-click on the
   patient file to load the data into the program.

To use Volume Rendering to crop a VOI:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For this step we use the `Volume Rendering
module <https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/volumerendering.html>`__,
a built-in module for 3D Slicer. 1. Load the Dicom files as described in
the section To load DICOM
`data <https://github.com/smiths/aorta#to-load-dicom-data>`__. 2. Once
loaded, select the Volume Rendering module. Select the volume that you
want to crop, and click on the eye icon on the left.

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align:center;line-height:0px;"><img src="_images/Volume_Rendering_module.png" alt="Select Volume Rendering Module from Modules list"></p>

3. Within the module UI, under Display, enable Crop Display ROI, open
   the eye for ROI, and select CT-Bones for the preset. You should be
   able to see the 3D rendering in the top right corner. You can drag
   the points controls to control the crop, and use the sliders at the
   top of the image to scroll through the slice.

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align:center;line-height:0px;"><img src="_images/Crop.png" alt="Use dots to select ROI"></p>

4. Change back to AortaGeomReconDisplayModule, you should also have a
   Volume rendering ROI or vtkMRMLMarkupsROINode object.
5. Select a new module, Crop volume, in Converters category. Select
   CreateNewVolumeParameters on Crop Volume Parameter Set.

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align:center;line-height:0px;"><img src="_images/Crop_volume_create_new_parameter.png" alt="Crop Volume module and create new parameter"></p>

6. For Input volume, select the volume to crop. For Input ROI, select
   the ROI we created with Volume Rendering module. The default name of
   the ROI is “Volume rendering ROI”. If you are unable to select ROI,
   go back to step 2 and use Volume Rendering module to create a ROI.
   For output volume, you can select create new volume or modify the
   original volume.

.. raw:: html

   <p style="text-align:center;line-height:0px;"><img src="_images/Crop_volume_parameters.png" alt="Selecting crop parameters, use ROI created by Volume Rendering and use the volume from DICOM patient file."></p>

7. Clicks on “Apply”, and change back to AortaGeomReconDisplayModule,
   you should be able to find a new volume or the cropped volume.
