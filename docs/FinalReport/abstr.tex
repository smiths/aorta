Assurance cases have been proven to be effective developing a real-time system software. Another domain that requires the high standard correctness, completeness, and consistency is medical software.

Throughout the development of the Aorta Geometry Reconstruction software, we implicitly listed the evidences that are essential to build our confidence in the software for assurance cases, build the artifact and the evidences simultaneously. 

Finally, we present this software with the list of the evidences built for assurance cases, to show that the assurance cases can apply well on the medical software
