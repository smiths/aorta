Assurance cases have been proven to be effective in developing real-time system software. Another domain that requires a high standard of correctness, completeness, and consistency is medical software. For this project, we develop a medical software, AortaGeomRecon, that helps to diagnose issues related to the aorta. Moreover, we build an assurance case for this software by adding details on the evidence based on the previous work that builds assurance cases for scientific software to reinforce our confidence in the AortaGeomRecon's correctness, completeness, and consistency.

With a Jupyter Notebook program left by a previous student as a starting point, we improve the existing algorithm and develop a 3D Slicer extension module that includes a Graphical User Interface, and input parameter module. We build the continuous integration infrastructure with GitHub Actions for the algorithm, this allows us to update the algorithm while making sure the algorithm is at least as good as its previous version. Additionally, a linter is set up as part of the continuous integration test to ensure the program's readability by enforcing the PEP8 standard.

Next, we build assurance cases in Goal Structuring Notation with the bottom-up approaches. We gather our existing evidence and explore new implementation requirements for the new evidence. We finalize our documentation on requirements, system architecture, user manual, and detailed design which reinforces our confidence in these documentations and the design complying with the documentation. Finally, we conduct a Code Review meeting and an Algorithm Review meeting to discuss our methodologies, which is insightful for future works.
