\chapter{Introduction}

Every thesis needs an introductory chapter

While you're here, you need to go into \texttt{definitions.tex} to set all the 
information needed for the front matter (e.g. title, author) and page 
header/footer.

You will also find the School of Graduate Studies' preparation guide (August 
2021) for theses and reports. I would give it a quick read so you know what's 
expected.
