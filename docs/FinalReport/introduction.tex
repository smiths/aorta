\section{Objective}
The main goals of this project starts with building a software that can quickly build the 3D geometry of the Aorta from CT Chest scans, while applying the assurance cases for this academic medical software. This project shows the assurance cases can indeed help build up our confidence in the medial software in general, because medical software like real-time system software, needed completeness and correctness.
