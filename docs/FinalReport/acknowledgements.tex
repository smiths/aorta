Above all, I want to extend my heartfelt appreciation to my supervisor, Dr. Spencer Smith.

His guidance has been instrumental throughout the entire research and thesis writing process.

Next, I would also like to express my gratitude to Kailin Chu for her significant contribution to the research, including the development of the initial segmentation algorithm, and for dedicating her time to help in our code review.

Furthermore, I extend my appreciation to Dr. Dean Inglis for his valuable insights into an alternative segmentation algorithm and for generously dedicating his time to assist in our algorithm review.

Lastly, I want to give a special thanks to my family. They have been there for me throughout my life, offering constant love and unwavering encouragement. Without them, I wouldn't have achieved this milestone.
